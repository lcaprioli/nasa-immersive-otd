Nasa Immersive of the Day - A showcase project all developed by myself

# Motivation
I am developing this project to expose my developer skills and evaluate my submission on a code challenge interview process. Although the scope was defined in the code challenge requirements, I will be looking forward to expand and build it on a such a way that any other developer could contribute like as on a team large scale project, so could be there some boiler-plate. I had like also to update myself on the nearest design patterns and practices for Flutter stack.

# Development strategy
- Code from the core to the border.
- Use the clean architecture approach. (link)
- Unit test each layer as it is finished.
- The navigation and injection dependency will use Modular().
- REST communication services will use Dio and the local storage will use Hive.
- No code generation will be used at all.
