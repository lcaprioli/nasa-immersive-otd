# nasa-immersive-otd
Nasa Immersive of the Day - A showcase project all developed by myself

Motivation
I am developing this project to expose my developer skills and evaluate my submission on a code challenge interview process. Although the scope was defined in the coach challenge requirements, I will be looking forward to expand and build it on a such a way that aany other developer could contribute like as on a team large scale project. I had like also to update myself on the nearest design patterns and practices for Flutter stack.
